# Welcome

The OneDep Deposition API provides a mechanism for a programatic access to OneDep deposition system.

An API is used to provide access.  The low level api is documented on [apiary.io](https://depapi1.docs.apiary.io).

This site provides examples of the API as well as providing a wrapper that is designed to make it easier for the end user to use.  It will also ensure that as changes to the API are introduced, the wrapper will ensure compatibility.


Please refer to the Command line and wrapper documentation [overview](cli.md) or the [wrapper api](depositapi.md)
